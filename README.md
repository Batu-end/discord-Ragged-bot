# discord-Ragged-bot
A test bot for discord

# V1 - Responds with specified messages, to messages that:
-  start with a certain character(s)
-  contain a certain word anywhere within the message
-  start and end with the same characters

# V2 - Responds to messages that request gif responses:
-  the message format must be in "gif x." , where 'x' is the desired search term for the gif
-  uses the GIPHY API instead of the regular Tenor gifs , so results may differ from the search results within the Discord gifs section
